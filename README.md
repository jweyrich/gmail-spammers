# Gmail Spammers

__Chrome extension__ that gathers all email addresses from your Gmail Spam folder and present them as a clean list for your ~~appreciation~~ disgust.

To see it in action, just navigate to your Spam folder (and between newer/older pages).

__Disclaimer__: I wrote this during an afternoon to learn a bit about Chrome extensions and eventually help me feed and curate the [spam-filters][1].
